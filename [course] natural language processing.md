## Week 1 - Introduction to Natural Language Processing

### Introduction (Part 1)

-   What is NLP?
    -   Computers using natural language as input and/or output.
    -   NLU: understanding, input
    -   NLG: generation, output.

Tasks

-   Oldest task: **machine translation**. Convert between two languages.
-   **Information extraction**
    -   Text as input, structure of key content as output.
    -   e.g. job posting into industry, position, location, company, salary.
    -   Complex searches ("jobs in Boston paying XXX").
    -   Statistical queries ("how has jobs changed in IT changed over time?")
-   **Text summarization**
    -   Condense one or many documents into a summary.
    -   [*Columbia Newsblaster*](http://newsblaster.cs.columbia.edu/) is an example.
-   **Dialogue systems**
    -   Humans can interact with a computer to ask questions and achieve tasks.

Basic NLP problems

-   **Tagging**
    -   Map strings to tagged sequences (each word is lexed and tagged with an appropriate label).
    -   **Part-of-speech tagging**: noun, verb, preposition, ...
        -   Profits (N) soared (V) at (P) Boeing (N)
    -   **Named Entity Recognition**: companies, locations, people
        -   Profits (NA) soared (NA) at (NA) Boeing (C)

-   **Parsing**
    -   e.g. "Boeing is located in Seattle" into a parse tree.

### Introduction (Part 2)

Why is NLP hard?

-   **Ambiguity**
    -   "At last, a computer that understands you like your mother"; three intrepretations at the *syntactic* level.
    -   But also occurs at an *acoustic* level: "like your" sounds like "lie cured".
        -   One is *more likely* than the other, but without this information difficult to tell.
    -   At *semantic* level, words often have more than one meaning. Need context to disambiguate.
        -   "I saw her duck with a telescope".
    -   At *discourse* (multi-clause) level.
        -   "Alice says they've built a computer that understands you like your mother"
        -   If you start a sentence saying "but she...", who is she referring to?

What will this course be about

-   **NLP subproblems**: tagging, parsing, disambiguation.
-   **Machine learning techniques**: probabilistic CFGs, HMMs, EM algorithm, log-linear models.
-   **Applications**: information extraction, machine translation, natural language interfaces.

## Week 1 - The Language Modeling Problem

### Introduction to the Language Modeling Problem (Part 1)

-   We have some finite vocabulary, i.e.

$$V = \{the, a, man telescope, Beckham, two, ...\}$$

-   We have countably infinite set of strings, which are the set of possible sentences in the language:

$$V^+ = \{"the\:STOP", "a\:STOP", "the\:fan\:STOP", ...\}$$

-   STOP is a stop symbol at the end of a sentence. Convenient later on.
-   Sentences don't have to make sense, just every sequence of words.
-   Also a sentence could just be {"STOP"}, empty.

-   We have a *training sample* of example sentences in English.
    -   Sentences from the New York Times in the last 10 years.
    -   Sentences from a large set of web pages.
    -   In the 1990's 20 million words common, by the end of the 90's 1 billion words common.
    -   Nowadays 100's of billions of words.

-   With this training sample we want to "learn" a probabiliy distribution p, i.e. p is a function that satisfies:

$$\sum_{x \in V^+} p(x) = 1, \quad p(x) \ge 0 \; \forall \; x \in V^+$$

-   For any sentence x in language, p(x) >= 0.
-   If we sum over all sentences x in language, p(x) sums to 1.
-   A good language model assigns high probabilities to likely sentences in English (the fan saw Beckham STOP), low probabilities to unlikely sentences in English (Beckham fan saw the STOP)

### Introduction to the Language Modeling Problem (Part 2)

-   But...why do we want to do this?!
    -   **Speech recognition** was original motivation; related problems are optical character recognition and handwriting recognition.
    -   Input: sound wave time series.
    -   Preprocess: split into relatively short time periods, e.g. 10ms.
    -   For each frame do a Fourier transform, get energies of frequencies.
    -   Problem is to output recognised speech, sequence of words.
    -   Main course notes: it's useful to have prior probabilities so that if we can choose between alternatives we can ask "which is most likely?".  
        -   "recognise speech" vs "wreck a nice beach"
    -   The estimation techniques developed for this problem will be very useful for other problems in NLP.

-   Naive method of language modelling
    -   We have N training sentences.
    -   For any sentence $x_1, ..., x_n$, define $c(x_1, ..., x_n)$ as the number of times the sentences is seen in our training data.
    -   Naive estimate:

$$p(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{c(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}{N}$$

-   This is a valid, well-formed language model (p(x) sums to 1, they're all >= 0).
-   However, they'll assign a probabiliy of 0 to any unseen sentences; no ability to generalise to new sentences.
-   How can we build language models that generalise beyond the test sentences?

### Markov Processes (Part 1)

-   Markov Processes
    -   Consider a sequence of random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$.
    -   Each random variable can take any value in a finite set V.
    -   For now assume n is fixed, e.g. = 100. Every sequence is the same length.
    -   Our goal: model the joint probability distribution of the values of these n variables:

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots, X_n = x_n)$$

-   This is huge: for vocabulary V, number of sequences of length n is $|V|^n$.

-   First-Order Markov Processes
-   Going to use the chain rule of probabilities to decompose the expression into a product of expressions.
-   For two expressions, this rule is:

$$P(A,B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$$
$$P(A,B,C) = P(A) \times P(B|A) \times P(C|A,B)$$

-   Hence:

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2) = P(X_1 = x_1) \times P(X_2 = x_2 | X_1 = x_1)$$
$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, X_3 = x_3) = ... P(X_3 = x_3 | P(X_2 = x_2, X_1 = x_1)$$

-   This kind of decomposition is *exact*: this is always true, and no assumptions are involved.
-   Hence the general decomposition:

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots, X_n = x_n)$$
$$=P(X_1 = x_1) \prod_{i=2}^{n} P(X_i = x_i\;|\;X_1 = x_1, \dots, X_{i-1} = x_{i-1})$$

-   Continuing on, with first-order Markov assumption:

$$= P(X_1 = x_1) \prod_{i=2}^{n} P(X_i = x_i\;|\; X_{i-1} = x_{i-1})$$

-   The first-order Markov assumption: for any $i \in \{2, \dots, n\}$, for any $x_1, \dots, x_n$:

$$P(X_i=x_i|X_1=x_1, \ldots, X_{i-1} = x_{i-1}) = P(X_i=x_i | X_{i-1} = x_{i-1})$$

-   Random variable at position i depends on just the previous value, on the variable at position (i-1).
    -   $X_i$ is conditionally independent of all the other random variables once you condition on $X_{i-1}$.

###Â Markov Processes (Part 2)

-   What about Second-Order Markov Processes?
-   Again, the problem is to model the joint distribution over $n$ random variables:

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots, X_n = x_n)$$
$$=P(X_1 = x_1) P(X_2 = x_2 | X_1 = x_1) \prod_{i=3}^{n} P(X_i = x_i | X_{i-2} = x_{i-2}, X_{i-1} = x_{i-1})$$

-   For elements further along in the sequence the value for the i'th random variable depends on the previous *two* random variables.
-   This is a bit awkward, so for convenience we assume $x_0 = x_{-1} = *$, where $*$ is a special "start" symbol.

$$= \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i = x_i | X_{i-2} = x_{i-2}, X_{i-1} = x_{i-1})$$

-   For example, $x_{-1} = *,\;x_0 = *,\;x_1 = the,\;\ldots$,

#### Modelling Variable Length Sequences

-   Want $n$ to also be a random variable.
-   Simple solution: always define $X_n = STOP$, where $STOP$ is a special symbol.
-   Use a Markov process as before, but assume $X_n = STOP$.

### Trigram Language Models

-   A trigram language model consists of:
    1.  A finite set $V$ (the words, the vocabulary).
    2.  A parameter $q(w|u,v)$ for each trigram $u,v,w$ such that $w \in V \bigcup \{STOP\}$, and $u,v \in V \bigcup \{*\}$.
        -   For each *trigram* $u,v,w$, a sequence of three words, we have a parameter $q(w|u,v)$.
        -   $w$ could be any element of V or STOP, and
        -   $u,v$ could be any element of V or START.

-   For any sentence $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ where $x_i \in V$ for $i = 1 \ldots (n-1)$, and $x_n = STOP$, the probability of the sentence under the trigram model is:

$$p(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}q(x_i\;|\;x_{i-2},x_{i-1})$$

-   where we define $x_0 = x_{-1} = *$.
-   i.e. for any sentence the probability of it is the product of second-order Markov probabilities of its constituent trigrams.

An example. For the sentence

        the dog barks STOP

we could have

$p(\textrm{the dog barks STOP}) =$  
$q(\textrm{the | *, *})$  
$\times q(\textrm{dog | *, the})$  
$\times q(\textrm{barks | the, dog})$  
$\times q(\textrm{STOP | dog, barks})$  

-   This is still a naive language model. It's easy to find problems.
-   PCFGs, explored later, are much superior.
-   Having said that, trigram language models are extremely useful.
    -   They are very hard to improve upon.
    -   Considerable simplicity.

- - -

-   Quiz: say we have a language model with $V = \{\textrm{the, dog, runs}\}$, and the following parameters:

$q(\textrm{the | *, *}) = 1$  
$q(\textrm{dog | *, the}) = 0.5$  
$q(\textrm{STOP | *, the}) = 0.5$  
$q(\textrm{runs | the, dog}) = 0.5$  
$q(\textrm{STOP | the, dog}) = 0.5$  
$q(\textrm{STOP | dog, runs}) = 1$  

-   There are **three** sentences with non-zero probability under this model. Draw out a graph, where nodes are words and edge labels denote probabilities, to see this.

- - -

#### The Trigram Estimation Problem

-   But what are the values of parameters q?
-   This turns out to be a challenging problem.
-   A natural estimate: the **maximum likelihood estimate (ML)**.
-   Recall that we assume that we have a training set, some example sentences in our language, typically, as you recall, millions or billions of sentences.
-   From these sentences we can derive counts; how often do trigrams occur?

$$q(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) = \frac{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1},w_{i})}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})}$$

-   For example:

$$q(\textrm{laughs | the, dog}) = \frac{\textrm{Count(the, dog laughs)}}{\textrm{Count(the, dog)}}$$

-   This is intuitive. For instances of a particular bigram how often are they followed by the particular third word of our trigram?

- - -

-   Quiz: consider the following corpus of sentences:
    -   the dog walks STOP
    -   walks the dog STOP
    -   dog walks fast STOP
-   Let $q_{ML}$ by the maximum-likelihood parameters of a trigram langauge model trained on this corpus. Which of the following parameters have a value that is both well-defined and non-zero?

Correct:

$q_{ML}({\textrm{walks | *, dog}})$  
$q_{ML}({\textrm{dog | walks, the}})$  
$q_{ML}({\textrm{walks | the, dog}})$  


Incorrect:

$q_{ML}({\textrm{walks | dog, the}})$  
$q_{ML}({\textrm{fast | dog, the}})$  
$q_{ML}({\textrm{STOP | walks, dog}})$  

- - -

-   ML is a useful starting point, but has serious problems.

Spare Data problems

-   Say our vocabulary size is $N = |V|$, then there are $N^3$ parameters in our model.
-   e.g. $N = 20,000\;\implies\;20,000^3 = 8 \times 10^{12}$ parameters. 
-   Most parameters will be zero; most possible trigrams will not appear.
-   But does that mean all trigrams we haven't seen are necessarily impossible to *ever* see? No.
-   Worse still, the bigram denominator may be zero, and the ML ratio is undefined.

### Evaluating Language Models: Perplexity

-   We have some test data, $m$ sentences, i.e. $s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_m$. Each of these is a sentence in the language, e.g. {the dog laughs STOP}.
-   Additionally, assume that use some *development* data to determine the language model parameters, but hold out some additional *test data* to evaluate the language model.
-   Natural to look at the probability that our language model gives to sentences in the test data $\prod_{i=1}^{m}p(s_i)$; it's never seen it before.

$$\textrm{log}\;\prod_{i=1}^{m} p(s_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \textrm{log}\;p(s_i)$$

-   (the above is a basic rule of logarithms; log of product = sum of logs).
-   recall that e.g.:

$$p(s_i) = q(\textrm{the | *, *}) \times q(\textrm{dog | *, the}) \times \ldots$$

-   Naturally we'd expect better languages models to assign higher probabilities to sentences in the test data.
-   And log is a monotonically increasing function, so expect the sum of logs to correspondingly be higher for better language models.

-   In fact, the usual evaluation measure is **perplexity**:

$$\textrm{Perplexity} = 2^{-l},\;\textrm{where}$$
$$l = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \textrm{log}\;p(s_i)$$

-   and M is the total number of *words* in the test data. In some sense with (1/M) the perplexity is now stable with respect to the size of the test data.
-   The *lower* the perplexity the *better the fit* of the language model to the test data.

Some Intuition about Perplexity

-   Say we have vocabulary $V$, and $N = |V| + 1$, and the dumbest possible model predicts:

$$q(w|u,v) = \frac{1}{N},\;\forall\;w \in V \cup \{\textrm{STOP}\},\;\forall\;u,v \in V \cup \{\textrm{*}\}$$.

-   This dumbest model assigns the uniform distribution over all possible words in each possible. Ignores previous words, doesn't measure relative frequency.
-   Easy to calculate perplexity:

$$\textrm{Perplexity} = 2^{-l},\;\textrm{where}\;l=\textrm{log}\;\frac{1}{N}$$
$$\implies\; \textrm{Perplexity} = N$$

-   !!AI implying all these calculations use log base 2.
-   Perplexity is a measure of effective "branching factor".
    -   The model is as confused on test data as if it had to choose uniformly and independently among P possibilities per word, where P is the perplexity. Source: [Wikipedia:Perplexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity).

Quiz: define a trigram language model with the following parameters:

-   q(the | *, *) = 1
-   q(dog | *, the) = 0.5
-   q(cat | *, the) = 0.5
-   q(walks | the, cat) = 1
-   q(STOP | cat, walks) = 1
-   q(runs | the, dog) = 1
-   q(STOP | dog, runs) = 1

Now consider a test corpus with the following sentences:

-   the dog runs STOP
-   the cat walks STOP
-   the dog runs STOP

Note that the number of words in this corpus, M, is 12.

What is the perplexity of the language model, to 3dp?

$$P = 2^{-l}$$
$$l = \frac{1}{M} \sum \textrm{log}_2\{p(s_i)\}$$

$p(\textrm{the dog runs STOP}) = q(\textrm{the | *, *}) \times q(\textrm{dog | *, the}) \times q(\textrm{runs | the, dog}) \times q(\textrm{STOP | dog, runs})$  
$= 1 \times 0.5 \times 1 \times 1 = 0.5$

$p(\textrm{the cat walks STOP}) = q(\textrm{the | *, *}) \times q(\textrm{cat | *, the}) \times q(\textrm{walks | the, cat}) \times q(\textrm{STOP | cat walks})$  
$= 1 \times 0.5 \times 1 \times 1 = 0.5$

$l = \frac{1}{12} \{ 3 \times \textrm{log}_2(0.5) \}$
$=\frac{1}{12}(-3) = \frac{-1}{4}$  
$p=2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2} = 1.189\;\textrm{(3dp)}$

####Â Typical values of perplexity (Goodman)

-   $|V| = 50,000$.
-   Trigram model, second-order Markov process, $p(x_1 \dots x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} q(x_i|x_{i-2},x_{i-1})$ gave perplexity = 74.
-   This is vastly smaller than the vocabulary size, so this is vastly superior to the uniform distribution.
-   Bigram model, a first-order Markov process, $p(x_1 \ldots x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}q(x_i|x_{i-1})$ gave perplexity = 137.
-   Unigram model, $p(x_1 \ldots x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} q(x_i)$, gave perplexity = 955.
    -   Predicting each word without using context of previous words.

#### Some history

-   Shannon conducted experiments on entropy of English. See "Prediction and entropy of printed English", 1951.
-   Chomsky, in "Syntactic Structures", 1957
    -   "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"
    -   "Furiously sleep ideas green colorless"
    -   Argues probability has little to offer for semantic sense and grammatical validity.
    -   Very much against Shannon's experiments with Markov processes and language.
    -   Later in the course we'll look at PCFGs that capture long-range dependencies.

## Week 1 - Parameter Estimation in Language Models

### Linear Interpolation (Part 1)

-   Recall the "Sparse Data Problems" section before.

#### The Bias-Variance Trade-Off

-   Trigram ML estimate

$$q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) = \frac{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1},w_i)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})}$$

-   Bigram ML estimate

$$q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-1}) = \frac{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-1},w_i)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-1})}$$

-   Unigram ML estimate

$$q_{ML} = \frac{\textrm{Count}(w_i)}{\textrm{Count}()}$$

-   The trigram MLE's advantage is that it conditions on a lot of context, so given sufficient training data these counts will be high and it will converge to the "true value".
    -   This has **relatively low bias**. It is able to generalise from one particular training set to other unknown data.
-   The unigram MLE completely ignores context, and so it will converge to a less-good estimator as the number of training samples increases.
    -   This has **relatively high bias**.

-   The trigram MLE's disadvantage is that many counts will be equal to zero, so we need many samples to get a good estimate.
    -   This has **relatively high variance**. It needs far more data to be able to generalise; if it has insufficient data it will not learn / generalise.
-   The unigram MLE's count will converge relatively quickly to their expected value, and so don't need many samples.
-   The bigram MLE is in between the trigram MLE and unigram MLE.

###Â Linear Interpolation (Part 2)

####Â Linear Interpolation

-   Take our estimate $q(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1})$ to be:

$= \lambda_1 \times q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1})$  
$+ \lambda_2 \times q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-1})$  
$+ \lambda_3 \times q_{ML}(w_i)$

-   where $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1$ and $\lambda_i \ge 0\;\forall\; i$.
-   New estimate is a weighted average of the three MLEs.
-   For example, assuming $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = \frac{1}{3}$

$q(\textrm{laughs | the, dog})$  
$= \frac{1}{3} \times q_{ML}(\textrm{laughs | the, dog})$  
$+ \frac{1}{3} \times q_{ML}(\textrm{laughs | dog})$  
$+ \frac{1}{3} \times q_{ML}(\textrm{laughs})$  

- - -

Quiz: we are given the following corpus:

-   the green book STOP
-   my blue book STOP
-   his green house STOP
-   book STOP

Assume we compute a language model based on this corpus using linear interpolation with $\lambda_i = \frac{1}{3}\;\forall\;i \in \{1,2,3\}$.

What is the value of the parameter $q_{LI}(\textrm{book | the, green})$ in this model to 3dp? (Note: please include STOP words in your unigram model).

$q_{LI}(\textrm{book | the, green})$  
$= \frac{1}{3} \times q_{ML}(\textrm{book | the, green})$  
$+ \frac{1}{3} \times q_{ML}(\textrm{book | green})$  
$+ \frac{1}{3} \times q_{ML}(\textrm{book})$  

$= \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{\textrm{Count(the, green, book)}}{\textrm{Count(the, green)}}$  
$+ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{\textrm{Count(green, book)}}{\textrm{Count(green)}}$  
$+ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{\textrm{Count(book)}}{\textrm{Count()}}$  

$= \frac{ \frac{1}{3}(1) }{(1)} + \frac{ \frac{1}{3}(1) }{(2)} + \frac{ \frac{1}{3}(3) }{(14)}$  
$= 0.571\;\textrm(3dp)$  

- - -

Our estimate correctly defines a distribution. Define $V^{'} = V \cup \{STOP\}.$

$\sum_{w \in V^{'}} q(w|u,v)$  
$=\sum_{w \in V^{'}} [\lambda_1 \times q_{ML}(w|u,v) + \lambda_2 \times q_{ML}(w|v) + \lambda_3 \times q_{ML}(w)]$  

move out the constant lambdas:

$=\lambda_1 \sum_w q_{ML}(w|u,v) + \lambda_2 \sum_w q_{ML}(w|v) + \lambda_3 \sum_w q_{ML}(w)$

By definition the maximum likelihood estimates in a given trigram, bigram, or unigram model sum to 1. Intuitively, the probability of each given trigram, bigram, or unigram probability in the model sums to 1.

$= \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1$  

(Can also show that $q(w|u,v) \ge 0\;\forall\;w \in V^{'}$).

- - -

Quiz: say we have $\lambda_1 = -0.5, \lambda_2 = 0.5, \lambda_3 = 1.0$. Note that these satisfy the constraint $\sum_i \lambda_i = 1$, but violate the constraint that $\lambda_i \ge 0$.

Recalling our definition of $q$ above within: $\sum_{w \in V^{'}} q(w|u,v)$, it's hence true that there might be a trigram $u,v,w$ such that $q(w|u,v) \lt 0$ or $q(w|u,v) \gt 1$.

It is not true that we may have a bigram $u,v$ such that $\sum_{w \in V} q(w|u,v) \neq 1$.

- - -

#### How to estimate the $\lambda$ values?

-   Hold out part of the training set as "validation" data.
-   Define $c^{'}(w_1,w_2,w_3)$ to be the number of times the trigram $(w_1,w_2,w_3)$ is seen in the validation set.
-   Take some small portion of all of our sentences, say 5%, as validation.
-   We train on the 95% bigger portion.
-   Define $c^{'}$ as the number of times we see the training data in the smaller, other set.
-   Choose $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ to maximize:

$$L(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3) = \sum_{w_1,w_2,w_3} c^{'}(w_1,w_2,w_3)\;\textrm{log}\;q(w_3|w_1,w_2)$$

such that $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1$ and $\lambda_i \ge 0\;\forall\;i$ and where:

$q(w_i|w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) =$  
$\lambda_1  \times q_{ML}(w_i|w_{i-2},w_{i-1})$  
$+\lambda_2 \times q_{ML}(w_i|w_{i-1})$  
$+\lambda_3 \times q_{ML}(w_i)$  

-   Many of the $c^{'}(w_1,w_2,w_3)$ counts will of course be zero.
-   Optimization problem to maximize L, under the contraints that the lambdas are positive and sum to one.
-   If you maximize L it is easy to show that you minimize the perplexity of the language model with respect to the validation data.

#### Allowing the $\lambda$'s to vary

-   Take a function $\Pi$ that partitions histories, e.g. for some bigram:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) = \begin{cases}
        1, & \textrm{If Count}(w_{i-1},w_{i-2}) = 0\\
        2, & \textrm{If 1} \le \textrm{Count}(w_{i-1},w_{i-2}) \le 2\\
        3, & \textrm{If 3} \le \textrm{Count}(w_{i-1},w_{i-2}) \lt 5\\
        4, & \textrm{Otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

-   Introduce a dependence of the $\lambda$'s on the partition:

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        q(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) & = \lambda_1^{\Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} \times q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) \\
        &\; + \lambda_2^{\Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} \times q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-1}) \\
        &\; + \lambda_3^{\Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} \times q_{ML}(w_i)
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

-   where $\lambda_1^{\Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} + \lambda_2^{\Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} + \lambda_3^{\Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} = 1$, and $\lambda_i^{\Pi(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} \ge 0\;\forall\;i$.
-   Instead of just 3 lambdas now we have 3 * 4 = 12 lambdas, one per MLE per partition, and we determine which parition to use based on the bigram count.
    -   We condition on the bigram counts.
    -   $\lambda_1^1, \lambda_2^1, \lambda_3^1$. These counts are used if the bigram count is 0.
    -   $\lambda_1^2, \lambda_2^2, \lambda_3^2$. These counts are used if the bigram count is [1, 2].
    -   $\lambda_1^3, \lambda_2^3, \lambda_3^3$. These counts are used if the bigram count is [3, 5).
    -   $\lambda_1^4, \lambda_2^4, \lambda_3^4$. These counts are used if the bigram count is [5, $\infty$).
-   Partitions are generally chosen by hand, but this one is a typical definition.
-   These 12 lambdas are optimized according to L as before using validation data.
-   If this bigram count is 0 then parameter $\lambda_1$ will also be equal to 0, else it is undefined.
    -   Recall that $\lambda_1$ is for the trigram MLE, and the bigram count is in the denominator.

### Discounting Methods (Part 1)

-   Suppose we have a table of bigrams, their counts, and corresponding $q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-1})$.

x               Count(x) $q_{ML}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-1})$
------          -------- -------------------------
the             48                 
the, dog        15       $^{15}/_{48}$
the, woman      11       $^{11}/_{48}$ 
the, man        10       $^{10}/_{48}$
the, park       5        $^{5}/_{48}$
the, job        2        $^{2}/_{48}$
the, telescope  1        $^{1}/_{48}$
the, manual     1        $^{1}/_{48}$
the, afternoon  1        $^{1}/_{48}$
the, country    1        $^{1}/_{48}$
the, street     1        $^{1}/_{48}$

-   The MLEs are systematically high, especially if we have a large vocabulary. This is particularly true for the low count items.
-   In a sense these words that follow "the" are just lucky; what about those poor words that don't appear after "the" in this data set but, in the "true" language, actually can appear after "the"?

-   Now define "discounted" counts, $\textrm{Count}^{*}(x) = \textrm{Count}(x) - 0.5$

x               Count(x) Count*(x) $\frac{\textrm{Count*(x)}}{\textrm{Count(the)}}$
------          -------- --------- -------------------------
the             48                 
the, dog        15       14.5      $^{14.5}/_{48}$
the, woman      11       10.5      $^{10.5}/_{48}$ 
the, man        10       9.5       $^{9.5}/_{48}$
the, park       5        4.5       $^{4.5}/_{48}$
the, job        2        1.5       $^{1.5}/_{48}$
the, telescope  1        0.5       $^{0.5}/_{48}$
the, manual     1        0.5       $^{0.5}/_{48}$
the, afternoon  1        0.5       $^{0.5}/_{48}$
the, country    1        0.5       $^{0.5}/_{48}$
the, street     1        0.5       $^{0.5}/_{48}$

-   There is some missing or left over probability mass; if we sum the right-hand column you get $\frac{43}{48} \lt 1$.
-   The left over probability mass, in this case, is $\frac{5}{48}$.
-   The essence of discounting is to take this left over probability mass and distribute it back to the words that do not appear after "the" in this data set.

-   We'll define for any word $w_{i-1}$ $\alpha$, which is the left-over or missing probability mass:

$$\alpha(w_{i-1}) = 1 - \sum_{w} \frac{\textrm{Count}^{*}(w_{i-1},w)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-1})}$$

-   e.g. in our example, $\alpha(\textrm{the}) = 10 \times 0.5/48 = 5/48$.

- - -

Quiz: assume that we are given a corpus with the folloiwng properties:

-   Count(the) = 70
-   |{w: c(the, w) > 0}| = 15, i.e. there are 15 different words that follow "the".

Furthermore assume that the discounted counts are defined as $c^{*}(\textrm{the,w}) = c(\textrm{the,w}) - 0.3$. Under this corpus, what is the missing probability mass $\alpha(\textrm{the})$ to 3dp?

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
    \alpha(\textrm{the}) & = 1 - \sum_{w} \frac{\textrm{Count}^{*}(\textrm{the, w})}{\textrm{Count(the)}} \\
    & = \frac{\textrm{Count(the)}}{\textrm{Count(the)}} - \frac{1}{\textrm{Count(the)}} \times \sum_{w} \textrm{Count}^{*}(\textrm{the,w}) \\
    & = \frac{\textrm{Count(the)} - \sum_{w} \textrm{Count}^{*}\textrm{(the, w)}}{\textrm{Count(the)}} \\
    & = \frac{\textrm{Count(the)} - \sum_{w} \left\{ \textrm{Count(the, w)} - 0.3\right\}}{\textrm{Count(the)}} \\
    & = \frac{\textrm{Count(the)} + \sum_{w}(0.3) - \textrm{Count(the)}}{\textrm{Count(the)}} \\
    & = \frac{0.3w}{\textrm{Count(the)}} \\
    & = \frac{(0.3)(15)}{70} = 0.064\;\textrm{(3 dp)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

- - -

#### Katz Back-Off Models (Bigrams)

-   For a bigram model, define two sets

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        A(w_{i-1}) & = \left\{w : \textrm{Count}(w_{i-1},w) \gt 0\right\} \\
        B(w_{i-1}) & = \left\{w : \textrm{Count}(w_{i-1},w) = 0\right\}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

-   Assuming $\alpha$ such that:

$$\alpha(w_{i-1}) = 1 - \sum_{w \in A(w_{i-1})} \frac{\textrm{Count}^{*}(w_{i-1},w)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-1})}$$

-   And $\textrm{Count}^{*}$ is such that:

$$\textrm{Count}^{*}(w_{i-1},w_i) = \textrm{Count}(w_{i-1},w_i) - \gamma\\ \textrm{where $\gamma$ is a constant}$$. 

-   A bigram model

$$
\begin{equation}
    q_{BO}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-1}) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{\textrm{Count}^{*}(w_{i-1},w_i)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-1})}, & \textrm{If } w_i \in A(w_{i-1})\\
        \alpha(w_{i-1})\frac{q_{ML}(w_i)}{\sum_{w \in B(w_{i-1})} q_{ML}(w)}, & \textrm{If } w_i \in B(w_{i-1}) 
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

-   $A(w_{i-1})$ is the set of words whose bigram count is greater than 0, so they follow e.g. "the".
-   $B(w_{i-1})$ is the set of words whose bigram count is 0, so they're never seen to follow e.g. "the".
-   $\alpha(w_{i-1})$ is the missing probability mass.
-   $\frac{\textrm{Count}^{*}(w_{i-1},w_i)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-1})}$ is the discounted count for the words who are seen to follow e.g. "the".
-   If the word is never seen after e.g. "the", rather than set its $q(w_i|w_{i-1})$ parameter to 0 we assign it a portion of the missing probabiliy mass $\alpha(w_{i-1})$, in proportion to its the unigram maximum-likelihood estimate $q_{ML}(w_i)$ divided by the sum of all the unigram MLEs for other such words $\sum_{w \in B(w_{i-1})} q_{ML}(w)$.

- - -

Quiz: Let's return to a smaller version of our corpus:

-   the book STOP
-   his house STOP

This time we computer a bigram language model using Katz back-off with $c^{*}(v,w) = c(v,w) - 0.5$.

What is the value of $q_{BO}(\textrm{book | his})$ estimated from this corpus?

$$w_i = \textrm{book}, w_{i-1} = \textrm{his}$$

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        A(\textrm{his}) & = \textrm{{house}} \\
        B(\textrm{his}) & = \textrm{{his, the, book, STOP}}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

Draw a table for $w_{i-1}$ and all words that follow it, in order to determine $\alpha(w_{i-1})$

x           Count(x)   Count*(x)
----------  --------   ---------
his         1          
his, house  1          0.5

$$\alpha(\textrm{his}) = 1 - (0.5)/(1) = 0.5$$

Since $\textrm{book} \in B(\textrm{his})$, i.e. since "book" never follows "his" in the corpus:

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        \sum_{w \in B(w_{i-1})} q_{ML}(w) & = q_{ML}(\textrm{his}) + q_{ML}(\textrm{the}) + q_{ML}(\textrm{book}) + q_{ML}(\textrm{STOP}) \\
        & = (1/6) + (1/6) + (1/6) + (2/6) \\
        & = 5/6
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        q_{BO}(\textrm{book | his}) & = \alpha(w_{i-1})\frac{q_{ML}(w_i)}{\sum_{w \in B(w_{i-1})} q_{ML}(w)} \\
        & = (0.5) \times \frac{(1/6)}{(5/6)} \\
        & = 0.1
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

### Discounting Methods (Part 2)

#### Katz Back-Off Models (Trigrams)

-   For a trigram model, first define two sets

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        A(w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) & = \left\{w : \textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1},w) \gt 0\right\} \\
        B(w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) & = \left\{w : \textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1},w) = 0\right\}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

-   A trigram model is defined in terms of the bigram model:

$$
\begin{equation}
    q_{BO}(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{\textrm{Count}^{*}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1},w_i)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})}, & \textrm{If } w_i \in A(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})\\
        \alpha(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})\frac{q_{BO}(w_i|w_{i-1})}{\sum_{w \in B(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} q_{BO}(w|w_{i-1})}, & \textrm{If } w_i \in B(w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) 
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

where

$$\alpha(w_{i-2},w_{i-1}) = 1 - \sum_{w \in A(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})} \frac{\textrm{Count}^{*}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1},w)}{\textrm{Count}(w_{i-2},w_{i-1})}$$

-   The one variable is the discount constant. It is typically between 0 and 1, and it can also be chosen via optimization on a validation data set.

###Â Summary

-   Three steps in deriving the language model probabilities:
    1.  Expand $p(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n)$ using *Chain Rule*.
    2.  Make *Markov Independence Assumptions*, i.e. $p(w_i\;|\;w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}) = p(w_i\;|\;w_{i-2},w_{i-1})$
    3.  *Smooth* the estimates using low order counts; linear interpolation and discounting.

-   Other methods used to improve language models
    -   "Topic" or "long-range" features.
        -   Condition on the topic of the document within which sentences belong.
        -   Condition on words outside of the two-word window under the second-order Markov assumption.
    -   Syntactic models
        -   Grammatical information.

-   It's generally hard to improve on trigram models though!

##Â Week 2 - Tagging Problems and Hidden Markov Models

### The Tagging Problem

####Â Part-of-Speech Tagging

-   **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: a fundamental problem.
    -   Input: sentence.
    -   Output: a tag sequence.

-   Input, some sequence of words, a sentence:

```
Profits soared at Boeing Co., easily topping forecasts on Wall
Street, as their CEO Alan Nulally announced first quarter
results.
```

-   Tags:

```
N   =   Noun
V   =   Verb
P   =   Preposition
Adv =   Adverb
Adj =   Adjective
...
```

-   Output, a *tag sequence*:

```
Profits/N soared/V at/P Boeing/N Co./N ,/, easily/ADV
topping/V forecasts/N on/P Wall/N Street/N ,/, as/P
their/POSS CEO/N Alan/N Mulally/N announced/V first/ADJ
quarter/N results/N ./.
```

-   But context matters.
    -   `profits` isn't always a noun, it can sometimes be a verb.
    -   `topping` is a verb, but can sometimes be a noun.
    -   ...

####Â Named Entity Recognition

-   **Named Entity Recognition**
    -   Input: a sentence.
    -   Output: identify names and their type (company, location, person, ...)

-   Input: same as above
-   Output:

```
Profits soared at [Company: Boeing Co.], easily ...
[Location: Wall Street], ..., [Person: Alan Mulally]
```

-   At first blush named entity recognition looks like segmentation, not part-of-speech tagging. But really they're the same.

####Â Named Entity Extraction as Tagging

-   Input: same as above
-   Tags:

```
NA  =   No entity
SC  =   Start Company
CC  =   Continue Company
SL  =   Start Location
CL  =   Continue Location
...
```

-   Output:

```
Profits/NA soared/NA at/NA Boeing/SC Co./CC ,/NA easily/NA
topping/NA ... Wall/SL Street/CL ,/NA ... CEO/NA Alan/SP
Mulally/CP ...
```

-   We are *encoding* the named entity boundaries as a tag sequence.

- - -

Quiz: given sentence: `Profits are topping all estimates`.

We also know:

-   `Profits` can be N or V.
-   `are` is V
-   `topping` can be N, ADJ, or V.
-   `all` can be DT, ADV, or N.
-   `estimates` can be N or V.

How many tag sequences are possible?

$$= 2 \times 1 \times 3 \times 3 \times 2 = 36$$

- - -

-   Objective: treating this like a supervised machine learning problem
    -   Use a very common resource, called the "Wall Street Journal Treebank".
    -   Features: sentences (not individual words).
    -   Training set: 38,219 sentences, each with tagged words.
        -   Annotated by hand (!)
    -   Label: a sentence with each word tagged.
    -   !!AI there are a lot of tags here. A reference list of tags is available in the [Penn Treebank Tags](http://bulba.sdsu.edu/jeanette/thesis/PennTags.html).
    -   Output: a functon that maps sentences to tagged words.

-   There are now many corpora available, across many languages.

#### Two Types of Contraints

```
Influential/JJ members/NNS of/IN ... bailout/NN agency/NN
can/MD raise/VB capital/NN ./.
```

-   What will help us in this problem? Two constraints:
    1.   **Local**: e.g. *can* is more likely to be a modal verb (MD) than a noun (NN).
        -   A [modal verb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb) (MD) is an auxillary verb used to indicate likelihood, ability, permission, and obligation.
    2.  **Contextual**: e.g. a noun (NN) is more likely than a verb (VB*) to follow a determiner (DT).
        -   (e.g. `the can` is more likely to refer to a can of soup than talk about `the`'s ability to do something)
        -   A [determiner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner) (DT) is a word, phrase, or affix that occurs together with a noun (NN).
        -   DT can be indefinite articles (`the`, `a`, `an`), demonstratives (`this`, `that`), quantifiers (`many`, `few`, `several`).
        -   Recall that an affix is a morpheme that attaches to word stems. Can be prefix, suffix, infix (in the middle of a word) or circumfix (on both sides of the word)
-   Sometimes the contraints are in conflict:

```
The trash can is in the garage.
```  

-   `can` has a *local* preference to be a modal verb (MD) because it follows a noun.
-   But clearly `can` belongs as a whole with `trash can`, so it depends on *context*.
-   We can build a model that balances these two contraints.

### Generative Models for Supervised Learning

#### Supervised Learning Problems

-   We have training examples $x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}$ for $i = 1 \ldots m$.
-   Each $x^{(i)}$ is an **input**, each $y^{(i)}$ is a **label**.
-   Objective: learn a function $f$ that maps inputs $x$ to labels $f(x)$.
-   e.g.

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        & x^{(1)} = \textrm{the dog laughs}, & y^{(1)} = \textrm{DT NN VB} \\
        & x^{(2)} = \textrm{the dog barks}, & y^{(2)} = \textrm{DT NN VB} \\
        & \ldots & \ldots
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

-   The first model you may consider is a **conditional model**.
    -   Learn a distribution $p(y|x)$ from training examples.
    -   For any test input $x$, define $f(x) = \textrm{arg max}_{y}p(y|x)$.
        -   The $y$ that maximizes this conditional probability.
        -   Input $x$, search through all possible $y$'s, return most likely $y$.
-   Alternative are generative models.

####Â Generative Models

-   Same problem.
-   Learn a *joint distribution* $p(x,y)$ from training examples.
    -   Before we had $p(y|x)$.
-   Often we have $p(x,y)$ = $p(y)p(x|y)$.
    -   **Bayes Rule**.
    -   $p(y)$ is the **prior** probability; how likely is $y$ a-priori?
    -   $p(x|y)$ is the **conditional** probability. *Given* $y$ how likely is $x$?

-   Note: by the total probability variant of Bayes Rule we have:

$$p(y|x) = \frac{p(y)p(x|y)}{p(x)}$$

-   where:

$$p(x) = \sum_y p(y)p(x|y)$$

-   Estimating $p(y|x)$ *directly* is often referred to as a **discriminative model**.
    -   We will see a lot of discriminative models later in the course.
-   Estimating $p(x,y)$ is a **generative model**.
-   There are pros and cons to each, a lot of research, back and forth.

-   How do we apply a generative model to a new test example?
-   Output from the model:

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        f(x) & = \textrm{argmax}_{y}\;p(y|x) \\
             & = \textrm{argmax}_{y}\;\frac{p(y)p(x|y)}{p(x)} \\
             & = \textrm{argmax}_{y}\;p(y)p(x|y)
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

-   Second line: assuming we have a generative model, by Bayes Rule.
-   Third line: $p(x)$ does not vary with $y$. $\textrm{argmax}$ implies we're searching over $y$, but denominator is constant and hence we can discard it.
    -   This is computationally very useful, can be expensive to calculate.

### Hidden Markov Models

-   We have an input sentence $x = x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$. ($x_i$ is the $i$'th word in the sentence).
-   We have a tag sequence $y = y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. ($y_i$ is the $i$'th tag in the sentence).
-   We'll use an HMM to define:

$$p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$$

-   for any sentence $x_1 \ldots x_n$ and tag sequence $y_1 \ldots y_n$ of the same length.
    -   Note this is **generative** ($p(x,y)$), not **discriminative** ($p(y|x)$).
    -   Think of the $x_i$ as an input and the $y_i$ as a label.

-   Then the most likely tag sequence for $x$ is:

$$\textrm{arg}\underset{y_1 \ldots y_n}{\textrm{max}} p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$$

-   The number of total possible sequences is $O(2^n)$, so brute force search is not feasible.

#### Trigram Hidden Markov Models (Triagram HMMs)

-   For any sentence $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, where $x_i \in V$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, and
-   For any tag sequence $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{n+1}$, where $y_i \in S$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ and $y_{n+1} = \textrm{STOP}$.
-   The joint probability of the sentence and tag sequence is:

$$p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{n+1}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n+1} q(y_i|y_{i-2},y_{i-2}) \prod_{i=1}^{n} e(x_i|y_i)$$

-   An example of the joint probability could be $p(\textrm{the, dog barks, DT, NN, VB, STOP})$.
-   The first product is a trigram model applied to tag sequences! Very similar to before.
    -   One $q$ term for each tag *including the STOP symbol*.
-   The second product could have e.g. $e(\textrm{the | DT})$ is the probability of a tag emitting or generating a word.
    -   One $e$ term for each (tagged) word.

-   where we've assumed, as before in Markov Models, that $x_0 = x_{-1} = {*}$ (the start symbol).
-   $V$ is the set of possible words in the language, e.g. $\{\textrm{the, dog, book, ate, his}\}$
-   $S$ is the set of possible tags, e.g. $\{\textrm{DT, NN, VB, P, ADV, ...}\}$.
    -   $\simeq$ hundreds of tags; the Wall Street Journal courpus has $\simeq$ 50 tags.

-   Parameters of the model:
    -   $q(s|u,v)\;\forall\;s \in S \cup \{\textrm{STOP}\},\;u,v \in S \cup \{\textrm{*}\}$
        -   **Trigram parameters** (but referred to in a quiz as **transition parameters**).
    -   $e(x|s)\;\forall\;s \in S, x \in V$
        -   **Emission parameters**.

- - -

Quiz: Given tagset $S = \{\textrm{D, N}\}$, a vocabulary $V = \{\textrm{the, dog}\}$, and a HMM with transition parameters:

-   $q(\textrm{D | *, *}) = 1$
-   $q(\textrm{N | *, D}) = 1$
-   $q(\textrm{STOP | D, N}) = 1$
-   $q(s|u,v) = 0$ for all other $q$ params.

and emission parameters:

-   $e(\textrm{the | D}) = 0.9$
-   $e(\textrm{dog | D}) = 0.1$
-   $e(\textrm{dog | N}) = 1$

Under this model how many pairs of sequences $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{n+1}$ satisfy $p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{n+1}) \gt 0$?

First: how many non-zero-probability tag sequences are there? Enumerate them by drawing a graph of nodes and edges, where a node is a word and an edge is labelled with the transition probability to another word. Then follow all paths from any start symbol to any stop symbol whose product of probabilities is $\gt$ 0.

```
D, N, STOP
```

There's only one! OK. Refer back to your taq sequence graph and copy it for each possible word that a given tag (i.e. node) that it may "generate".  If e.g. N could generate two words, not one, we would have *four* possible sentences.

```
the dog
dog dog
```

There's only two! OK. Hence the answer itself is two, because we have just generated a sentence for each possible (tag, word) pair.

#### An example

If we have:

-   $n = 3$,
-   The sentence $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\} = \{\textrm{the, dog, laughs}\}$, and
-   The tag sequence $\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\} = \{\textrm{D, N, V, STOP}\}$.

Then:

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        & p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{n+1}) \\
      = & q(\textrm{D | *, *}) \times q(\textrm{N | *, D}) \times q(\textrm{V | D, N}) \times q(\textrm{STOP | N, V}) \times \\
        & e(\textrm{the | D}) \times e(\textrm{dog | N}) \times e(\textrm{laughs | V})
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

-   STOP is a special tag that terminates the sequence.
-   We take $y_0 = y_{-1} = \textrm{*}$, where $\textrm{*}$ is a special "padding" symbol.

- - -

Quiz: given set $S = \{\textrm{D, N, V}\}$, and vocabulary $V = \{\textrm{the, cat, drinks, milk, dog}\}$, and an HMM model:

-   transition parameters $q(s|u,v) = \frac{1}{4}\;\forall\;s, u, v$
-   generative parameters $e(x|s) = \frac{1}{5}\;\forall\; \textrm{tags}\;s\;\textrm{and words}\;x$.

What is the value, under this model, of:

$$p(\textrm{the, cat, drinks, milk, D, N, V, N, STOP})$$

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        & p(\textrm{the, cat, drinks, milk, D, N, V, N, STOP}) \\
      = & \prod_{i=1}^{n+1} q(y_i|y_{i-2},y_{i-2}) \prod_{i=1}^{n} e(x_i|y_i) \\
      = & \{ p(\textrm{the | *, *}) \times p(\textrm{cat | *, the}) \times p(\textrm{drinks | the, cat}) \times p(\textrm{milk | cat, drinks}) \times p(\textrm{STOP | drinks, milk}) \} \times \\
        & e(\textrm{the | D}) \times e(\textrm{cat | N}) \times e(\textrm{drinks | V}) \times e(\textrm{milk | N}) \\
      = & \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^5 \times \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

- - -

#### Why the Name?

-   The first product is a **second-order Markov Chain**
    -   Recall $p(x,y) = p(y) \times p(x|y)$
    -   This product is solving for $p(y)$.
-   The second project is $x_j$'s **being observed**.
    -   Strong independence assumption that each word depends only on its underlying, generating tag.
-   The generative process: we choose a sequence of tags, and then for each tag generate an associated word.
    -   The $y$'s are *not observed*.
    -   The $x$'s are *observed*.
-   And so we will flip this: given an observation find the most likely underlying (**hidden**) tag sequence.

- - -

Quiz: for a bigram HMM:

$$p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n+1} q(y_i|y_{i-1}) \prod_{i=1}^{n} e(x_i|y_i)$$

### Parameter Estimation in HMMs

#### Smoothed Estimation

e.g.

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        q(\textrm{Vt | DT, JJ}) & = \lambda_1 \times \frac{\textrm{Count(Dt, JJ, Vt)}}{\textrm{Count(Dt, JJ}} \\
                                & + \lambda_2 \times \frac{\textrm{Count(JJ, Vt)}}{\textrm{Count(JJ}} \\
                                & + \lambda_3 \times \frac{\textrm{Count(Vt)}}{\textrm{Count()}}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

$$\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1$$
$$\forall\;i, \lambda_i \ge 0$$

$$e(\textrm{base | Vt}) = \frac{\textrm{Count(Vt, base)}}{\textrm{Count(Vt)}}$$

-   For trigram / transition parameters:
    -   We can of course induce counts of tag sequences directly from our corpus, and then determine **maximum-likelihood estimates**.
        -   $\lambda_1$ for **trigram MLE**.
        -   $\lambda_2$ for **bigram MLE**.
        -   $\lambda_3$ for **unigram MLE**.
    -   Linear interpolation is used, as seen before.
-   For emission parameters:
    -   Can use **bigram MLEs**.

-   One problem.
-   $e(x|y) = 0\;\forall\;y$ if $x$ is never seen in the training data.
    -   !!AI sounds familiar! Will we do Laplacian smoothing, we we "add fudge" to everything, or back-off smoothing, where high mass gets re-distributed to zero mass, or something else?

- - -

Quiz: Given the following corpus:

-   the dog barks -> D N V STOP
-   the cat sings -> D N V STOP

Assume we've calculated MLEs of a trigram HMM from this data. What is the value of the emission parameter $e(\textrm{cat | N})$ from this HMM?

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        e(\textrm{cat | N}) = & \frac{\textrm{Count(N, cat)}}{\textrm{Count(N)}} \\
                            = & \frac{(1)}{(2)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

Say we estimate the transition parameters for a trigram HMM using linear interpolation, such that $\lambda_i = \frac{1}{3}$ for $i = \{1, 2, 3\}$. What is the value of the transition parameter $q(\textrm{STOP | N, V})$ under this model?

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        q(\textrm{STOP | N, V}) = & \lambda_1 \times \frac{\textrm{Count(N, V, STOP)}}{\textrm{Count(N, V)}} \\
                                + & \lambda_2 \times \frac{\textrm{Count(V, STOP)}}{\textrm{Count(V)}} \\
                                + & \lambda_3 \times \frac{\textrm{Count(STOP)}}{\textrm{Count()}} \\
                                = & \left(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{(2)}{(2)}\right) \\
                                + & \left(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{(2)}{(2)}\right) \\
                                + & \left(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{(2)}{(8)}\right) \\
                                = & 0.75
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

#### Dealing with Low-Frequency Words: An Example

-   Test sentence

```
Profits soared at Boeing Co., easily topping ...
CEO Alan Mulally.
```

-   `topping` and `Mulally` are likely to be infrequent.
-   Long tail: you will frequently encounter words in test data that you have never encountered in training data.
-   And hence: $e(\textrm{Mulally | y}) = 0$ for all tags $y$.
-   And it can be verified that the joint probability $p(x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_{n+1}) = 0$ for all tag sequences $y_1, \ldots, y_{n+1}$.
-   This is because all tag sequences will involve this emission parameter.
-   And hence all tag sequences are equally likely; applying argmax to an expression that *always* evaluates to zero implies that $y$ is equally maximum everywhere!

-   A common way of dealing with this:
    1.  **Split the vocabulary into two sets**.
        -   *Frequent words*: words occurring $\ge$ 5 times in training (or some threshold).
        -   *Low frequency words*: all other words.
    2.  **Map** low frequency words into a small, finite set, depending on affixes.
-   The set of low frequency words is very large.
-   Map each low frequency word to a small set of e.g. 20 new words.

-   from [Bikel et. al 1999] for named-entity recognition.

other                    ,              Punctuation, other words

-   These were chosen by hand with intuition.
-   We want to preserve some useful information for the specific task at hand, i.e. named entity recognition.
-   e.g. `firstWord` will be capitalized in the corpus, but we lowercase it because the capitalization does not give us useful information, because all words at the start of a sentence are capitalized.
-   We're mapping low-frequency words to classes that preserve spelling features.

Return to an old example. Before transformation:

```
Profits/NA soared/NA at/NA Boeing/SC Co./CC easily/NA
topping/NA forecasts/NA on/NA Wall/SL Street/CL ,/NA their/NA
CEO/NA Alan/SP Mulally/CP announced/NA first/NA quarter/NA
results/NA ./NA
```

After transformation:

```
firstword/NA soared/NA at/NA initCap/SC Co./CC ,/NA easily/NA
lowercase/NA forecasts/NA on/NA initCap/SL Street/CL ,/NA as/NA
their/NA CEO/NA Alan/SP initCap/CP announced/NA first/NA
quarter/NA results/NA ./NA
```

-   Resolving low-frequency words in a way that preserves their spelling is useful for the named-entity recognition problem.
-   Build our HMM on this transformed data.
    -   $e(\textrm{firstword | NA})$
    -   $e(\textrm{initCap | SC})$
-   We're **closing** the vocabulary.
-   This is a simple method, but requires human heuristics.

### The Viterbi Algorithm for HMMs

-   How to apply HMMs to new test sentences?

#### Problem

-   For a *new* test input sentence $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, map it onto the most likely set of tags, i.e. find:

$$\textrm{arg}\underset{y_1 \dots y_{n+1}}{\textrm{max}} p(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_{n+1})$$

-   where the arg max is taken over all seuqneces $y_1 \ldots y_{n+1)}$ such that $y_i \in S$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$ and $y_{n+1} = \textrm{STOP}$.

-   We assume that $p$ again takes the form:

$$p(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_{n+1}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n+1} q(y_i | y_{i-2}, y_{i-1}) \prod_{i=1}^{n} e(x_i | y_i)$$

-   Recall the assumptions that $y_0 = y_{-1} = \textrm{*}$ and $y_{n+1} = \textrm{STOP}$.

#### Brute Force Search is Hopelessly Inefficient

-   For example
    -   $x_1 \ldots x_n = \{\textrm{the, dog, laughs}\}$.
    -   $y_1 \ldots y_n = \{\textrm{D, N, V}\}$ (the correct answer).
    -   $S = \{\textrm{D, N, V}\}$ (assume that the set of all possible tags is just this).
-   So $|S| = 3$, and all possible tag sequences are all combinations (*not* permutations):
    -   D D D STOP
    -   D D N STOP
    -   D D U STOP
    -   D U D STOP
    -   ...
-   Only $3^3 = 27$ possible tag sequences.
-   Use the transmission and emissions parameters of the HMM model to assign probabilities to each particular tag sequnce, then choose the most likely tag sequence.
-   However, in the general case $|S|^n$, where $n$ is sentence length, is the number of possible sequences.

-   The transmission parameters only depend on sequences of length three for trigram HMMs.
    -   This structure allows a more efficient solution.

#### The Viterbi Algorithm

-   Define $n$ to be length of sentence.
-   Define $S_k$ for $k = -1, 0, \ldots, n$, to be set of possible tags at position $k$:

$$S_{-1} = S_0 = \{\textrm{*}\}$$
$$S_k = S\;\textrm{for}\;k \in \{1, 2, \ldots n\}$$

-   Define:

$$r(y_{-1}, y_0, y_1, \ldots, y_k) = \prod_{i=1}^{k} q(y_i | y_{i-2}, y_{i-1}) \prod_{i=1}^{k} e(x_i|y_i)$$

-   Note that, always, $y_{-1} = y_0 = \{\textrm{*}\}$.
-   This is a truncated $q$, as it only goes $i=1$ to $k$.
-   Define a dynamic programming table

$$\pi(k,u,v) = \textrm{maximum probability of a tag sequence ending in tags}\;u, v\;\textrm{at position}\;k$$.

i.e.

$$\pi(k,u,v) = max_{(y_{-1},y_0,y_{1},\ldots,y_k):y_{k-1}=u,\;y_k=v} r(y_{-1},y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_k)$$

-   $k$ takes any value $\{\textrm{1,2,...,n}\}$.
-   $u \in S_{k-1}$.
-   $v \in S_k$.

-   What do the $S$ and $k$ expressions at the begining imply:
    -   For example, (the, dog, laughs, D, N, V) implies $k = 3$.
    -   Each tag in $S$ could be responsible for generating a word in $x$.
        -   If $S = \{\textrm{D, N, V, P}\}$, then $x_1$ could be one of D, N, V, P, as is $x_2$, etc.

#### An Example

$$\underset{-1}{\textrm{*}}\;\underset{0}{\textrm{*}}\;\underset{1}{\textrm{The}}\;\underset{2}{\textrm{man}}\;\underset{3}{\textrm{saw}}\;\underset{4}{\textrm{the}}\;\underset{5}{\textrm{dog}}\;\underset{6}{\textrm{with}}\;\underset{7}{\textrm{the}}\;\underset{8}{\textrm{telescope}}\;$$

-   Assume $S = \{\textrm{D, N, V, P}\}$
-   What does $\pi(7, \textrm{P}, \textrm{D})$ mean, intuitively?
    -   The probability of the most likely tag sequence ending at the word in position 7 such that the last two tags are (P, D).
    -   Fix 'with' (6) to P.
    -   Fix 'the' (7) with D.
    -   Each preceding word has four possible tags.
        -   'dog' (5) could be D, N, V, P.
        -   'the' (4) could be D, N, V, P.
        -   'saw' (3) could be D, N, V, P.
        -   'man' (2) could be D, N, V, P.
        -   'The' (1) could be D, N, V, P.

- - -

Quiz: We have a trigram HMM model with the following transition parameters:

-   $q(\textrm{D | *, *}) = 1$
-   $q(\textrm{N | *, D}) = 1$
-   $q(\textrm{V | D, N}) = 1$
-   $q(\textrm{STOP | N, V}) = 1$

and emission parameters:

-   $e(\textrm{the | D}) = 0.8$
-   $e(\textrm{dog | D}) = 0.2$
-   $e(\textrm{dog | N}) = 0.8$
-   $e(\textrm{the | N}) = 0.2$
-   $e(\textrm{barks | V}) = 1.0$

Say we have the sentence:

```
the dog barks
```

What is the value of $\pi(3, \textrm{N}, \textrm{V})$?

-   Intuitively, this reads as 'what is the probability of the most likely tag sequence that ends at position 3 such that the last two tags are N and V?'
-   First, expand and label your test sentence, omitting the STOP symbol:

$$\underset{-1}{\textrm{*}}\;\underset{0}{\textrm{*}}\;\underset{1}{\textrm{the}}\;\underset{2}{\textrm{dog}}\;\underset{3}{\textrm{barks}}$$

-   Draw a Markov Chain graph of your transmission parameters, covering every single possible path.
    -   Think of every tag as a node (including the start symbols), and an edge as moving from one tag to another with a certain probability.
    -   In our case this is very easy; there is only one path, i.e. $\textrm{* -> * -> D -> N -> V -> STOP}$, with probabilities of $1$ for each edge.

-   Eliminate all paths from the Markov Chain graph that do not meet the constraints of $\pi(3,\textrm{N},\textrm{V})$. Also eliminate any paths that contain an edge with zero probability.
-   For us, we only have one path, and this path meets the contraints of this function. 
-   Prove this to yourself by putting one finger on the start of the test sentence, and one finger on the start of the Markon Chain graph, and counting until $k=3$.

-   Your Markov Chain graph now covers every possible combination of tags that *could* match this test sentence. For each path calculate the product of probabilities from a start symbol to $k=3$. Determine which path gives you the highest probability.
-   In our case there is only one path, so the **most likely tag sequence** is (D, N, V).
-   This gives us the $q$ part of the $r$ expression.
-   For this tag sequence use the emission parameters to "generate" the appropriate word in order to calculate the $e$ parameters.
-   Mathematically:

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        r(y_{-1},y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_n) & = \prod_{i=1}^{k} q(y_i|y_{i-2},y_{i-1}) \prod_{i=1}^{k} e(x_i|y_i) \\
        r(\textrm{*, *, D, N, V}) & = \left\{ q(\textrm{D | *, *}) \times q(\textrm{N | *, D}) \times q(\textrm{V | D, N}) \right\} \times \\
        & \left\{ e(\textrm{the | D}) \times e(\textrm{dog | N}) \times e(\textrm{barks | V}) \right\} \\
        & = \left\{ 1 \times 1 \times 1\right\} \times \left\{0.8 \times 0.8 \times 1.0 \right\} \\
        & = 0.64
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

- - -

#### A Recursive Definition

-   Base case: $\pi(0, \textrm{*}, \textrm{*}) = 1$
    -   Every tag sequence starts with $\textrm{* *}$.
-   **Recursive definition**: $\forall\; k \in \{1 \ldots n\},\;\forall\; u \in S_{k-1}\;\textrm{and}\;v \in S_k:$

$$\pi(k,u,v) = \underset{w \in S_{k-2}}{\textrm{max}} (\pi(k-1),w,u) \times q(v|w,u) \times e(x_k|v))$$ 

-   $u$ can take any tag in $S_{k-1}$, $v$ can take any tag in $S_k$.
-   Notice how we're working backwards in the sentence back to the base case, the start.

#### Justification for the Recursive Definition 

(part 2)

$$\underset{-1}{\textrm{*}}\;\underset{0}{\textrm{*}}\;\underset{1}{\textrm{The}}\;\underset{2}{\textrm{man}}\;\underset{3}{\textrm{saw}}\;\underset{4}{\textrm{the}}\;\underset{5}{\textrm{dog}}\;\underset{6}{\textrm{with}}\;\underset{7}{\textrm{the}}\;\underset{8}{\textrm{telescope}}\;$$

What is $\pi(7, P, D)$?

-   Recall this puts 'with' (6) = P, 'the' (7) = D.
-   $u = \textrm{P}, v = \textrm{D}$
-   Note that $S_5 = S_4 = \ldots = S = \{\textrm{D, N, V, P}\}$.

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        \pi(7, \textrm{P}, \textrm{D}) = & \underset{w \in \{\textrm{D,N,V,P}\}}{\textrm{max}} \left\{ \pi(6, w, \textrm{P}) \times q(\textrm{D} | w, \textrm{P}) \times e(\textrm{the} | \textrm{D}) \right\}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

-   Any tag sequence ending in (P, D) must have included one previous tag in (D, N, V, P). The 'max' explicitly searches over these.

- - -

Quiz: assume $S = \{\textrm{D, N, V, P}\}$ and a trigram HMM with parameters:

-   $q(\textrm{D | N, P}) = 0.4$
-   $q(\textrm{D | w, P}) = 0$ for $w \neq N$.
-   $e(\textrm{the | D}) = 0.6$

We are also given the sentence:

```
Ella walks to the red house
```

Say the dynamic programming table for this sentence has the following entries:

-   $\pi(\textrm{3, D, P}) = 0.1$
-   $\pi(\textrm{3, N, P}) = 0.2$
-   $\pi(\textrm{3, V, P}) = 0.01$
-   $\pi(\textrm{3, P, P}) = 0.5$

What is the value of $\pi(\textrm{4, P, D})$?

-   $u = \textrm{P}$
-   $v = \textrm{D}$

$$
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        \pi(k,u,v) = & \underset{w \in S_{k-2}}{\textrm{max}} (\pi(k-1),w,u) \times q(v|w,u) \times e(x_k|v)) \\
        \pi(4, \textrm{P}, \textrm{D}) = & \underset{w \in \{\textrm{D, N, V, P}\}}{\textrm{max}} \left\{ \pi(3, w, \textrm{P}) \times q(\textrm{D} | w, \textrm{P}) \times e(\textrm{the | D}) \right\} \\
        = & \textrm{max} \left\{ 0.1 \times 0 \times 0.6, 0.2 \times 0.4 \times 0.6, 0.01 \times 0 \times 0.6, 0.5 \times 0 \times 0.6 \right\} \\
        = & 0.048
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
$$

### The Viterbi Algorithm

-   **Inputs**:
    -   a sentence $x_1 \ldots x_n$, a sequence of words
    -   transmisson parameters $q(s|u,v)$, 
    -   emission parameters $e(x|s)$.
-   **Output**:
    -   $\underset{y_1 \ldots y_{n+1}}{\textrm{max}} p(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_{n+1})$
    -   Notice this is *not argmax*; just returns max probability. A simple change later will fix this.
-   **Initializtion**:
    -   Set $\pi(0,\textrm{*},\textrm{*}) = 1$.
        -   Base case of the recursion.
-   **Definition**:
    -   $S_{-1} = S_0 = \{\textrm{*}\}$
        -   Can only have the star symbols at positions -1 and 0.
    -   $S_k = S\;\forall\;k \in \{1 \ldots n\}$   
        -   Recall e.g. {D, N, V, P}
-   **Algorithm**
    -   For $k = 1 \ldots n$:
        -   For $u \in S_{k-1}$, $v \in S_k$:
            -   $\pi(k,u,v) = \underset{w \in S_{k-2}}{\textrm{max}} (\pi(k-1,w,u) \times q(v|w,u) \times e(x_k|v))$
    -   **Return**: $\textrm{max}_{u \in S_{n-1},v \in S_n} (\pi(n,u,v) \times q(\textrm{STOP}|u,v))$

#### The Viterbi Algorithm with Backpointers

We want 'argmax', not 'max', i.e. the actual most-likely tag seuqence.


-   **Inputs**:
    -   a sentence $x_1 \ldots x_n$, a sequence of words
    -   transmisson parameters $q(s|u,v)$, 
    -   emission parameters $e(x|s)$.
-   **Output**:
    -   $\textrm{arg}\underset{y_1 \ldots y_{n+1}}{\textrm{max}} p(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_{n+1})$
-   **Initializtion**:
    -   Set $\pi(0,\textrm{*},\textrm{*}) = 1$.
-   **Definition**:
    -   $S_{-1} = S_0 = \{\textrm{*}\}$
    -   $S_k = S\;\forall\;k \in \{1 \ldots n\}$   
-   **Algorithm**
    -   For $k = 1 \ldots n$:
        -   For $u \in S_{k-1}$, $v \in S_k$:
            -   $\pi(k,u,v) = \underset{w \in S_{k-2}}{\textrm{max}} (\pi(k-1,w,u) \times q(v|w,u) \times e(x_k|v))$
            -   $bp(k,u,v) = arg \underset{w \in S_{k-2}}{max} (\pi(k-1,w,u) \times q(v|w,u) \times e(x_k|v))$

    -   Set $(y_{n-1},y_n) = \textrm{argmax}_{(u,v)} (\pi(n,u,v) \times q(\textrm{STOP}|u,v))$
    -   For $k = (n-2) \ldots 1$, $y_k = bp(k+1, y_{k+1}, y_{k+2})$
    -   **Return** the tag sequence $y_1 \ldots y_n$.

-   What is different?
    -   Don't just record $\pi$ at each point but also a backpointer $bp$; which tag achieved this max. Which tag is most likely at $k$ given $u,v$.
    -   We then have $\pi$ and $bp$ values.
    -   At the end we go backwards in the sequence.

-   Run-time complexity is $O(n \times |S|^3)$.
    -   We enter the $u,v$ loop $n \times |S|^2$ times.
    -   Each time we enter we need to search over $|S|$ possible tags.
    -   It is **linear** with respect to sentence length.
    -   Much better than brute force, which was $O(|S|^n)$.

### Readings

#### Speech and Language Processing, Chapter 3 (Words and Transducers)

##### 3.9: Word and Sentence Tokenization

-   p75: **Tokenization**: segmenting running text into words and sentences.
-   Consider:

        Mr.  Sherwood said reaction to Sea
        Containers' proposal has been "very
        positive." In New York Stock Exchange
        composite tradying yesterday, Sea Containers
        closed at $62.625, up 62.5 cents.

-   Notice that:
    -   There could be double-spaces, which are just typos and can be considered a word delimeter.
    -   With quotation marks the end of sentence period is *within* the quotation marks. The word *is not* `positive."`.
    -   There may be numbers in a sentence.
-   You might be tempted to treat punctuation as a word boundary.
    -   But what about `m.p.h.`, `Ph.D`, `AT&T`, `cap'n`, `01/02/06`, `google.com`.
-   Also want to expand clitic contractions.
    -   `what're` becomes `what are`.
    -   But apostrophes aren't always clitic contractions, e.g. `her books' covers`.
    -   Segmenting and expanding clitics can be done using **morpological parsing** presented in this chapter.
-   Depending on your application you may want to parse multiple words as single tokens, for example `New York` or `rock 'n' roll`.
    -   This requires a multiword expression dictionary of some sort.
    -   Tokenization is hence very closely reliant on **named entity detection**.

-   This is all just word segmentation.
-   **Sentence segmentation** is also important.
    -   `?` and `!` are relatively unambiguous markers of sentence endings.
    -   `.` is more ambiguous.
        -   `Mr.`, `Inc.`, `he said "howdy."`
        -   Sentence tokenization and word tokenization hence tend to be addressed together, 
-   Sentence tokenization methods build a *binary classifier*, either using rules or machine learning, to decide if a period is part of a word or a sentence boundary marker.
    -   Abbreviation dictionaries help to deal with abbreviations.
    -   State of the art methods use machine learning, but a sequence of regular expressions is still useful.
-   p77: Perl script based on Grefenstette, 1999.
-   p78: this is so simple that this suggests Finite State Transducers (FSTs) may also be easily implemented.
    -   This is the case. Karttunen et. al 1996 and Beesley and Karttunen 2003 give descriptions.

#### Speech and Language Processing, Chapter 4 (n-gram models)

-   p96: a **word** is the full inflected or derived form of a word.
    -   In English n-gram models are based on wordforms, not the **lemmas*, i.e. root.
    -   e.g. cat is the lemma, cats is the inflected wordform.
-   p96: n-gram models, and counting words in general, requires tokenization or text normalization; separating out punctuation, dealing with abbreviations, normalizing spelling, etc.
    -   Covered in Chapter 3.
-   p96: a **type** is a distinct word in a corpus.
-   p96: a **token** is any instance of a word in the corpus.
-   p102: typically divide our data ito 80% training, 10% development, and 10% test.
-   p104: quadrigram sentences based on Shakespeare are actually real Shakespeare.
    -   The n-gram probability matrices are very sparse.
-   p104: be sure to choose similar training and test copurses. Don't choose from different genres.
-   p105: **closed vocabulary** assumes we know all the words in the vocabulary.
    -   This can't possible be exactly true.
    -   There will be **out of vocabulary (OOV)** words.
    -   The percentive of OOV words in the test set is called the **OOV rate**.
    -   An **open voabulary** is one where we model OOV words by adding a pseudo-word called `<UNK>`. We train these probabilities as follows:
        1.  *Choose a fixed vocabulary* in advance.
        2.  *Convert* in the training set any OOV word to the unknown word token `<UNK>` in a text normalization step.
        3.  *Estimate* the probabilities for `<UNK>` from its counts just like any other regular word in the training set.

-   p105: **extrinsic evaluation** of language models is best; apply them to your problem and see which is best.
-   difficult in practice, so use **intrinsic evaluation** instead, which measures quality independent of any application.
-   **perplexity** is the most common intrinsic evaluation metric.
    -   Perplexity is a **weighted average branching factor** of a language. The number of possible next words that can follow any word.
    -   p107: It is closely related to the information theoretic notion of entropy.
-   p108: **smoothing** is modifications made to address poor estimates that are due to variability in small data sets.
    -   pull in probabiliy mass from higher counts, pile it on to zero counts.

-   p108: Laplacian smoothing.

p111: Good-Turing Discounting

-   Use count of things you've seen *once* (**singletons** or **hapax legomenons**) to re-estimate the frequency of zero-count things.
-   The **frequency of frequency c** is the number of n-grams that occur c times.
-   More formally:

$$N_c = \sum_{x\;:\;\textrm{Count(x)} = c} 1$$

-   The MLE count for $N_c$ is $c$. The Good-Turing estimate replaces this with a smoothed count $c^*$, as a function of $N_{c+1}$:

$$c^* = (c+1)\frac{N_{c+1}}{N_c}$$

-   We can use the equation above to replace the MLE counts for all the bins $N_1, N_2, \ldots$.
-   However, instead of using this equation directly to re-estimate the smoothed count $c^*$ for $N_0$, use the following which we can call the **missing mass**:

$$P_{GT}^{*}\;\textrm{(things with frequency zero in training)} = \frac{N_1}{N}$$

-   Here $N_1$ is the count of items in bin 1, i.e. seen once in the training set, and $N$ is the total number of items we have seen in training.
-   p113: some advanced issues in Good-Turing estimation
-   p114: Good-Turing discounting is not used by itself; it's only used in combination with backoff and interpolation, discused later.

- - -

-   We can use an n-gram "hierarchy", i.e. trigrams, bigrams, and unigrams.
-   In **backoff** if there is evidence of a higher order N-gram we use it exclusively.
-   In **interpolation** we always mix the probability esitmates of all N-gram estimators.

-   p115: interpolation.
-   p116: backoff
    -   is better than interpolation
    -   takes into account Good-Turing discounting.

- - -

-   p118: practical issues: toolkits and data formats
-  Since probabilities by definition are less than 1, the more probabilities we multiply together tha smaller they become.
-   Hence we use log probabilities rather than raw probabilities, and add in log space rather than multiply in linear space.
-   In order to report probabilities just take the "exp" of the logprob:

$$p_1 \times p_2 \times p_3 \times p_4 = exp(log p_1 + log p_2 + log p_3 + log p_4)$$

-   Backoff N-gram language models are generally stored in **ARPA format**
    -   Small header.
    -   List of all non-zero N-gram probabilities (all unigrams, followed by bigrams, followed by trigrams, etc).
    -   Each N-gram entry is stored with its discounted log probabiliy (in $\textrm{log}_{10}$ format) and its backoff weight $\alpha$.
    -   Backoff weights only necessary if the N-gram forms a prefix of a longer N-gram.
    -   Thus, for trigram grammar, the format of each N-gram is:

<TODO>

-   p119: e.g.

        \data\ 
        ngram 1=1000
        ngram 2=10000
        ngram 3=5000

        \1-grams:
        -0.4405     </s>
        -99         <s>
        -4.34443    the         -1.43973
        -4.5325     dog         -4.3438
        <snip>

        \2-grams:
        -3.43535    <s>     i     -5.353535
        -4.43333    i       went  0.0430843
        ...

        \3-grams:
        -3.3245     <s>     i     prefer     3.434
        ...

-   In training mode each toolkit takes a raw text file, one sentence per line, words separated by white-space.
-   It also takes parameters such as order $N$, thresholds, type of discounting. 
-   It outputs a language model in ARPA format.

-   In perplexity or decoding mode the toolkit take a language model in ARPA format, a sentence or corpus, and produces the probability and perplexity of the sentence or corpus.

<all TODO>

-   p119: Advanced smoothing methods: Kneser-Ney Smoothing
-   p121: it turns out that any interpolation model can be represented as a backoff model, hence stored in ARPA backoff format.
-   p121: class-based N-grams.
-   p122: language model adaptation and using the web
-   use web search hits to estimate trigram language model parameters.
-   works well in practice, even though only getting page counts and not word counts back.

-   p122: using longer distance information: a brief summary
-   state of the art systems use 4-grams and 5-grams.
-   After 6-grams up to 20-grams, Goodman found that no useful improvement.
-   **cache** model: use the preceding part of a test corpus and mix it into your trained language model when making predictions.
    -   words are often repeated.
    -   only works well in domains where you have perfect knowledge of words.
-   **topic-based**: train different language models for different kinds of words.
-   **latent-semantic indexing**: measure probability based on the word's similarity to preceding words, mix it in.
-   **trigger**: a word that is not adjacent but highly related, so we mix it in.
-   **skip N-grams**: we skip over an intermediate word.
-   **variable-length N-grams**: adjust context size.

-   pruning by removing low-probability events is important, and essential on low-power platforms like cellphones.
