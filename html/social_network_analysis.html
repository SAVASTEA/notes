<li>Nodes connect at random.</li>
<li>Undirected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two parameters:
<ul>
<li>N: number of nodes.</li>
<li>p: probability that any two nodes share an edge, OR</li>
<li>M: total number of edges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(N, p) model is binomial (review this). p = node, (1 - p) = no node.</li>
<li>Average degree = (N - 1) * p.
<ul>
<li>Each node has (N - 1) tries to get an edge.</li>

<li>In general average degree is the mean, expected(x) = sum(x) * p(x).</li>
<li>Variance in degree = (n-1) * p * (1-p)</li>
<li>In general variance = E[(X-u)^2] = sum(X-u)^2 * p(x).</li>
<li>Binomial approximations:

<li>Small p =&gt; Poisson. p_k = z^k * e^(-z) / k!</li>
<li>Large n =&gt; Normal.</li>

<h3 id="b-random-graphs-and-alternative-models"><a href="#TOC">2B: Random graphs and alternative models</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For a growing random graph there’s a marked increase in the giant component size when average degree = 1.
<ul>
<li>NetLogo -&gt; Sample Models -&gt; Network -&gt; Giant Component.</li>
<li>Imagine network of friends. If average degree = 1 there’s a chain of a friend to a friend to a …, hence giant component.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lattice percolation.
<ul>
<li>2D grid, each point has a probability p of being occupied.</li>
<li>How far can infinite liquid starting at origin travel?</li>
<li>Critical point at p = 0.5 - 0.55</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In general: at what average degree (i.e. density) to giant components appear?</li>
<li>In random graphs degree distribution has an exponential distribution.</li>
<li>In random graphs size of giant components ~ N, whereas size of other components ~ log(n).
<ul>
<li>Given two very large components any additional random edges are very likely to join them, hence intuitively only one giant component likely.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Given Erdos-Renyi graph with nodes N, average degree z, =&gt; average shortest path ~= log(N) / log(z).
<ul>
<li>Very hard to derive.</li>
<li>Intuitively N^l = z^l. i.e. the number of friends distance l away from you is z^l.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Closed triad: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction model</strong>
<ul>
<li>Like ER except only (1 - p_intro) chance of random edge. Else we ask an adjacent node for one of their edges (friend of a friend).</li>
<li>Relative to ER the <strong>introduction model</strong> has:
<ul>
<li>more closed triads (friends introduce you to friends)</li>
<li>longer average shortest path (instead of randomly connecting to distant nodes edges kept more local).</li>
<li>more uneven degree distribution (people with more connections get more edges, increasing returns)</li>
<li>smaller giant component at low p.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Static geographical model</strong>
<ul>
<li>Randomly place nodes on a 2D grid. Each node tries to connect to M neighbours.</li>
<li>Relative to ER:
<ul>
<li>narrower degree distribution (each node is aiming for the same number of neighbours).</li>
<li>longer average shortest path (geographically localised)</li>
<li>smaller giant component (less chance of random connections)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Random encounter model</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nodes at random on 2D grid. Then each node moves randomly until it encounters a node, and then makes an edge.</li>
<li>Relative to ER:
<ul>
<li>longer average shortest path.</li>
<li>smaller giant component.</li>
<li>more closed triads.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growth model</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nodes added over time.</li>
<li>Compared to ER:
<ul>
<li>More nodes with degree 1, as there are more younger nodes.</li>
<li>No more closed triads, because of young nodes.</li>
<li>Smaller giant component.</li>

<ul>
<li>How network structure affects diffusion.</li>
<li>Complex contagion thresholds; not enough for only one neighbour to affect you.</li>
<li>ER networks:
<ul>
<li>Higher density in ER network =&gt; faster diffusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scale-free, those that grow.
<ul>
<li>With preferential attachment more hubs so diffusion faster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Small world networks
<ul>
<li>Recall: high clustering yet short average shortest path.</li>
<li>In ring-lattice model of small-world networks rewiring gives us the short ASP.</li>
<li>Hence as probability of rewiring increases the rate of diffusion increases.</li>
<li>Even with a recovery rate greater than infection rate the rewiring allows a model that should die out to survive.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-complex-contagion"><a href="#TOC">6B: Complex contagion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Complex contagion is less able to use shortcuts because such shortcuts are typically a single edge, whereas we need &gt; 1 to exceed a threshold.</li>
<li>Network coordination.
<ul>
<li>Want to maximize your payoff.</li>
<li>Given <code>(p)</code> fraction play basketball, you get <code>a</code> payoff per friend for basketball.</li>
<li>Given <code>(1-p)</code> fraction play football, you get <code>b</code> payoff per friend for football.</li>
<li>If your friends don’t play what you’re playing you get no payoff.</li>
<li><code>d</code> neighbors.</li>
<li>If chooses A, payoff = <code>p * d * a</code></li>
<li>If chooses B, payoff = <code>(1-p) * d * b</code>.</li>
<li>So you should choose A if: <code>p d a &gt;= (1-p) d b</code>.</li>
<li>Or: <code>p &gt;= b / (a + b)</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In contagion networks one node changing color / preference can cause a cascade.</li>
<li>Implications for viral marketing - what small subset of nodes to choose to target for influence?</li>
<li>Community structure:
<ul>
<li>Enable ideas to spread in the presence of thresholds; the dense intra-community ties allow this.</li>
<li>Create isolated pockets impervious to outside ideas; the sparse inter-communiy ties allow this.</li>
<li>Allow different opinions to take hold in different parts of the network, see the previous point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if you are bi-colour / bi-preference (i.e. both simultaneously), but with a cost <code>c</code>?
<ul>
<li>e.g. being bilingual may mean you’re average at both, not expert at one.</li>
<li>Being bilingual reduces the incentive of others to choose between the two preferences, even if one is better or lower cost. Simply because bilingual nodes allow the choice to be avoided.</li>

<ul>
<li>Collusion likely in certain industry structures; few sellers, high seller concentration, homogenous products.</li>
<li>Number of two-way flows is N(N-1)/2, so fewer sellers =&gt; easier to coordinate.</li>
<li>Treat the internals of the conspiracy as a black box.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organizational crime examines individuals as agents, representing their organization and themselves.
<ul>
<li>Makes many simplifications about conspirator social organization, almost a black box as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expect <em>sparse, decentralized networks</em> if secrecy is only factor. But also need to communicate efficiently.</li>
<li>Small group research applies here: more routine tasks are more efficiently performed in centralized structures, more complex tasks in decentralized structures.</li>
<li>Organizational theorists have similar conclusions - more information-processing requires more decentralization.</li>
<li>Concealment vs. coordination.</li>
<li>Centrality: more central =&gt; can get better illegal deals for your company, but also mean more personal culpability.</li>
<li>Executives can delegate so can afford to be less central, hence predict less likely to get fined or prosectured.</li>
<li>Degree =&gt; legal culpability, where betweenness and closensess amounts to hearsay.</li>
<li>Undirected graph of Senate testimony where witnesses mention someone else. Also measure organizational rank.</li>
<li>Freeman’s three point centrality measures used. Also could have used Bonacich’s measures of sociometric status (Bonacich 1972) and influence (Bonacich 1987), Coleman’s measure of power (Coleman 1973), Burt’s measure of prestige (1980).</li>
<li>Also Stephenson and Zelen (1989)’s measure of point centrality where shortest paths are deliberately avoided.</li>
<li>Graph density =&gt; observed number of edges as percentage of maximum possible.</li>
<li>p849, figure 2: decentralized and centralized networks.</li>
<li>Graph centralization =&gt; ratio of centrality of most central point to maxmium possible centrality.</li>
<li>Results.</li>
<li>Turbines (recall, most information processing) had highest density and most centralization, contradicting small group and organizational theory.</li>
<li>Network decentralization did not protect against successful prosection; in turbine network less likely to be found guilty.</li>
<li>Top executives in decentralized conspiracies able to shield themselves from prosection, but when found guilty had larger fines.</li>
<li>Top executives in centralized conspiracies could not shield themselves, but when found guilty had smaller fines.</li>
<li>Middle managers more vulnerable than junior managers.</li>
<li>Degree centrality increases vulnerability. Not betweenness or closeness. However, degree does not affect penalities.</li>
<li>In centralized networks, e.g. turbines, small connected core and large periphery. Core dominated by top executives, who need to be hands on. Hence lower conviction rate but more top executives found guilty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Network Structure and Information Advantage (Aral / Alstyne)</strong>
<ul>
<li>How and why social structure affects economic outcomes.</li>
<li>Burt (1992) shows that structurally diverse networks (low in cohesion and structural equivalence) are more successful in e.g. wages, promotion, job placement, creativity (Burt 2004a). Other studies show similar. More novel information.
<ul>
<li>See p11 figure 1 for diagram of cohesion and structural equivalence.</li>
<li>p12 =&gt; sructural equivalence of two actors is Euclidean distance of their contact vectors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion: total amount and diversity of novel information increases at decreasing rate with network size and network diversity.</li>
<li>Weak ties to other parts of network important source of inormation (Granovetter 1973: 1371). Get redudant information from well connected local network (Burt 1992).</li>
<li>Burt (2004b): “creativity is an import-export game, not a creation game”.</li>
<li>Do diverse networks actually provide access to more novel information? No.
<ul>
<li>Less diverse, stronger connected links have less novel information but higher bandwidth, so maybe more information.</li>
<li>Nodes aware of more redundant information in local network so they adjust their transmission to avoid redundancy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even with new information does productivity necessarily rise? No.</li>
<li>p19, vector space model of communication content. Emails categorized into set of topic vectors, individuals’ email’s diversity is variance of topic vectors.</li>
<li>Results.</li>
<li>Total and diversity of novel information increasing with node’s network size and network diversity, but marginal increase decreses with network size.</li>

<ul>
<li>The human disease network (Goh et. al)
<ul>
<li>(This is an excellent paper, good basis for how to explore a bipartite network).</li>
<li><strong>locus heterogeneity</strong>: genetic disorders that arise from mutations in more than one single gene.</li>
<li><strong>allelic heterogeneity</strong>: different mutations in the same gene giving rise to phenotypes currently classified as different disorders.</li>
<li>Should be able to do better than single-gene-single-disorder approach.</li>
<li>Link all genetic disorders (“disease phenome”) with complete list of disease genes (“disease genome”).</li>
<li><p>“diseasome”.</p></li>
<li>bipartite graph of two disjoint sets of nodes: genetic disorders and genes.</li>
<li>edge if mutations in that gene are implicated in that disorder.</li>
<li>with this diseasome bipartite graph generate two biologically relevant network projections:
<ul>
<li>“human disease network”. nodes are disorders, connected with they share at least one gene.</li>
<li>“disease gene network”. nodes are disease genes, connected if they are associated with same disorder.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>large giant component. =&gt; genetic origins of most disases are shared with other diseases.</li>
<li>degree distribution =&gt; disorders only connected to a few other diseases.</li>
<li>large cancer cluster tightly interconnected due to many genes associated with multiple types of cancer.</li>
<li><p>Others diseases under-represented in giant component, do not form a single distinct cluster.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Product Space Conditions the Development of Nations
<ul>
<li>Imagine a product is a tree, set of products a forest.</li>
<li>Firms are monkeys jumping tree to tree.</li>
<li>Traditional growth theory assumes all trees equally within reach.</li>
<li>However, if forest is heterogenous, with some dense areas and some sparse areas, monkeys may be unable to easily move through some parts of the forest.</li>
<li>Distance between trees could be:
<ul>
<li>intensity of labor, land, capital.</li>
<li>level of technological sophistication,</li>
<li>inputs and outputs involved in product’s value chain.</li>
<li>requisite institutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rather than make a-priori distance assumptions, instead assume that co-produced goods are related. “proximity”.</li>
</ul></li>
