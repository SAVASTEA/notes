(via Coursera)

## Lecture notes

### 1.1: Human Computer Interaction

-	Often iterative.
-	Focus on users.
-	Good design shifts user's attention from manipulating the interface to accomplishing a task.
-	People's tasks, goals, and values drive development.
-	Work with users, but they're just one stakeholder.

### 1.2: The Power of Prototyping

-	Reflective conversation with materials.
-	Goal is not artifact, it is feedback.
-	Question rendered as an artifact for other designers or users. Ask lots of questions.
-	Prototypes are nearly always, and should be, incomplete.
-	Prototyping is a strategy for efficiently dealing with things that are hard to predict.
-	Focus on goals, evolve the designs.
-	The rights of a prototype:
	-	Should not be required to be complete.
	-	Should be easy to change.
	-	Gets to retire.
-	Rapid prototyping is simulated annealing; local improvement isn't enough.

### 1.3: Evaluating Designs

-	Different methods achieve different goals.
-	Iteratively bring people into your office and watch them (usability studies).
	-	Setting isn't valid, but can stil learn lessons.
	-	Experimental bias; users try harder, be nicer.
	-	Psychological burden to bring someone to you.
-	Surveys
	-	Easy to execute and analyse results.
	-	Difference between what people say and what people do.
-	Focus Groups
	-	Groups of people different. People more submissive or erratic due to group psychology.
	-	Difficult for taboo topics or sexual topics.
-	Feedback from Experts
	-	Heuristic evaluation.
-	Comparative Experiments.
	-	Which option is more effective.
	-	Better then surveys because you see what users do.
	-	Better than usability studies because involves more than one option.
	-	But if online can't see them, and if in person the contrived setting may bias results.
-	Participant Observation.
	-	What users do in their actual scenario, not just short term.
-	Simulation models.
-	Issues to consider
	-	Reliability / precision
	-	Generalisability.
	-	Realism.
	-	Comparison.
	-	Work involved.

### 1.4: The Birth of HCI.

-	Vannevar Bush wrote article in 1940 in the Atlantic about Memex.
	-	Envisioned how future coulod allow people to produce and consume infomation.
	-	Camera on head, hypertext.
-	Grace Hopper invented the compiler and their interfaces.
-	Graphical User Interface.
	-	Input over output, so more intuitive.
-	Doug Engelbart invented the mouse.
-	Alan Kay, at Xerox PARC, prototyped the Dynabook, created the WIMP Windows-Icon-Mouse-Pointer (WIMP) GUI.

### 2.1: Participant Observation

-	"You can observe a lot just by watching".
-	Tacit knowledge: deep hanging out.
-	Five questions:
	-	What do people do now?
	-	What values and goals do people have?
	-	How are these activities embedded in larger ecology?
		-	e.g. buses. What leads people to need buses?
		-	Broaden your scope.
	-	Similarities and differences across people.
	-	â€¦and other types of context, like time of day.
-	Apprentice yourself.
	-	Set up partnership with observee.
	-	Be taught the process.
	-	Observer practices.
	-	Validate your observations; ask observee what they mean.
-	Pay attention to all artifacts. 
	-	**Look for workarounds and hacks.**
	-	**Errors are a goldmine**.
-	**Difference between what people say and what people do.**

### 2.2: Interviewing

-	Choosing participants.
	-	May be current users, or also non-users but potential future users.
	-	Use incentives and motivation; in SF $50-100, or gift certificate.
	-	Approximate if necessary; better than nothing.
-	Malcolm Gladwell
	-	Everything is interesting. Be curious.
	-	Don't start at the top or bottom. Start at the middle. Talk to the people who actually do the work.
	-	People at the top have power to lose, not as interested in sharing knowledge.
-	Bad questions.
	-	No: "Is the daily update an important feature to you?"
	-	Don't lead people. Use data to back up open ended questions.
	-	Yes: "Judging by logs I see that you don't use the daily update feature? Tell me more. Why is that?"
	-	No: "What would you like in a tool?".
	-	Users don't know about design, can't help you like this.
	-	Other types of question to avoid:
		-	Likes and wants in hypothetical scenarios.
		-	How often they do things.
		-	How much they like things on an absolute scale.
		-	Avoid binary questions.
-	Good questions
	-	Open ended, especially at beginning.
	-	(A little bit of) silence is golden. Let them answer.

### 2.3: Additional needfinding strategies

-	Longitudinal or sporadic behavior?
	-	**Diary studies.**
		-	Give them a diary, complete at a specified time or interval.
		-	Structured task.
		-	Written, camera, voice; but tailor to context.
		-	Scales better than direct observation.
		-	Entries must be as frictionless as possible. Better results.
		-	May require practice, training, reminding.
-	**Experience Sampling, aka pager studies**
	-	Phone beeps, then you fill in a form.
	-	Psychometric.
-	**Lead users**
	-	Individually create solutions to their problems.
	-	Designers collaborate to bring their solutions to market.
	-	Before early adopters.
	-	Don't work well if the improvement is process or knowledge based; difficult to diffuse / market.
-	**Extreme users.**
	-	Everyone gets email. But some people get a lot.
	-	Sometimes some useful ideas, but they're not representitive users.
-	Keeping users in mind.
	-	Don't forget users!
	-	**Personas**.
		-	A model of a person, an example.
		-	Demographics, motivation, beliefs, intentions, behaviour, and goals.
		-	Draw a picture or have a photo of persona.
		-	Name, occupation, background, social situation, hopes, dreams, and goals. A story!
		-	You can build empathy. Empathy leads to insights.
		-	Keep design consistent over time.
-	Ultimately, it's about design. This will help you find one, but not strict.

### 3.1: Paper Prototypes and Mockups

-	Over course of project fidelity increases.
	-	Storyboard, lowest.
	-	Paper prototypes, low.
	-	Digital mockups, low.
	-	Onwards.
-	**Don't focus on user interface before focusing on the task at hand**.
-	**Storyboarding isn't about pretty pictures, it's about communicating ideas**.
-	Star people
	-	Circle, then body like a star. Very crude. Then add sight lines, boards.
-	First objective: **illustrate a goal**.
-	Last objective: **people accomplishing goals**.
-	Storyboards should convey:
	-	**Settings**.
		-	People, environment, tasks.
	-	**Sequence**
		-	Steps.
		-	What leads someone to use the app, impetus?
		-	What task is being illustrated?
	-	**Satisfaction**
		-	What motivates people to use system?
		-	What does it enable people to accomplish?
		-	What need does the system fill?
-	Benefits of storyboarding
	-	**Holistic**. Emphasize how interfaces accomplish tasks without commiting to particular interfaces.
	-	Gets all the stakeholders on the same page with respect to the goal.
-	Time limits help, e.g. 10 minutes per panel.
-	Then, **paper prototyping**.
-	Paper prototyping tips and tricks
	-	Get a physical box and put all materials in one place! easy to lose or damage it.
	-	Work quickly, reuse by e.g. photocopying.
	-	If something is difficult to simulate allow users to ask verbal questions.
	-	Mix and match hardware and software. Print out a photo of the hardware then put software elements in it.
-	**Test multiple paper prototypes simultaneously**.
-	Get users or other stakeholders to help design.
-	Form and feedback co-evolve. Fidelity increases, feedback detail increases.

### 3.2: Faking it - Wizard-of-Oz Prototyping

-	Simulate machine behaviour with human operators.
-	Make an interactive application without much code.
-	Get feedback from users.
	-	Hi fidelity => users think it's real, more reluctant to be critical.
	-	Low fidelity => more license to suggest changes.
-	Steps:
	1.	Map out scenarios and application flow.
		-	What happens in response to user behavour?
	2.	Put together interface skeletons.
	3.	Develop "hooks" for wizard input.
	4.	Where and how the wizard will provide input.
		-	Remember you'll eventually replace with software.
	5.	Rehearse wizard role with a colleague.
-	Running wizard-powered prototypes:
	-	Practice with a friend first.
	-	Once comfortable recruit "users": train stations, cafes, etc.
	-	Two roles: facilitator and wizard.
		-	Facilitator: provides tasks and takes notes.
		-	Wizard: operator interface (more authenticate if hidden or remote).
	-	User feedback could be:
		-	Think aloud.
		-	Retrospective (if thinking aloud is distracting).
		-	Heuristic evaluation
		-	Debrief and reward users.
-	Advantages:
	-	Faster, cheaper, quicker iterations.
	-	Creating multiple variations easy.
	-	More "real" than paper prototypes.
	-	Identifies bugs and problems with current design.
	-	User-centric.
	-	Can evision very difficult ideas now.
	-	Designers learn too.
-	Disadvantages:
	-	May be too optimistic about technology, e.g. perfect speech recognition.
	-	Technology may never be possible.
	-	Some features or limitations are too difficult to wizard.

### 3.3: Faking It - Video Prototyping

-	Benefits:
	1.	Cheap and fast.
	2.	Great communication tools.
		-	Shows context, self-explanatory.
	3.	Development spec.
	4.	Ties interface designs to tasks.
		-	Check completeness of interface.
		-	Check nothing extra there.
-	Any fidelity, but usually low.
	-	Often coupled with paper prototypes.
-	Content
	-	Like storyboard, the whole task, including motivation (impetus) and success (narrative).
	-	Draw on tasks you've observed.
	-	Illustrate important tasks, MVP.
-	Steps:
	1.	Start with outline, or your storyboards.
	2.	Camera, people, realistic location.
	3.	Focus on message rather than production value.
-	Considerations:
	-	Audio or silent? Audio can be finicky, can use cue cards instead.
	-	Interface can be paper, mock-ups, code, or invisible (just showing task)
	-	Can show both success and failure.
	-	Edit as little as possible, editing sucks.
-	Furher reading:
	-	Wendy MacKay.

### 3.4: Creating and comparing alternatives

-	Duncker: **functional fixation**
	-	Once objects are biased to a particular purpose it's difficult to see them otherwise.
-	**Prototype in parallel**, not in serial.
	-	More diverse output, simulated annealing escapes local maxima.
	-	Better rated output.
-	Separating ego from artifact.
	-	If you have different ideas, it's easier to see that judgements are based on your artifacts.
-	Parallel encourages comparison, and comparison aids learning.
-	**Create and share multiple designs**.
	-	Feel better in team environments.
	-	Alternatives provides a vocabulary for teams to discuss the space of possible solutions.

	5.	**Error prevention**.
		-	Eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them.
		-	Confirmation of action commits.
	6.	**Recognition rather than recall**.
		-	Instructions and options should be visible and easily retrievable.
	7.	**Flexibility and efficiency of use**.

	8.	**Aesthetic and minimalist design**.
		-	Remove irrelevant or rarely needed information.
	9.	**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**.
		-	Plain language.
		-	Explain problem and suggest solution.
	10.	**Help and documentation**.
		-	Better that system is usable without docs.
		-	But docs should exist, easy to search, focused on user's task, concrete.
