## Lecture notes

### 1.1: Human Computer Interaction

-	Often iterative.
-	Focus on users.
-	Good design shifts user's attention from manipulating the interface to accomplishing a task.
-	People's tasks, goals, and values drive development.
-	Work with users, but they're just one stakeholder.

### 1.2: The Power of Prototyping

-	Reflective conversation with materials.
-	Goal is not artifact, it is feedback.
-	Question rendered as an artifact for other designers or users. Ask lots of questions.
-	Prototypes are nearly always, and should be, incomplete.
-	Prototyping is a strategy for efficiently dealing with things that are hard to predict.
-	Focus on goals, evolve the designs.
-	The rights of a prototype:
	-	Should not be required to be complete.
	-	Should be easy to change.
	-	Gets to retire.
-	Rapid prototyping is simulated annealing; local improvement isn't enough.

### 1.3: Evaluating Designs

-	Different methods achieve different goals.
-	Iteratively bring people into your office and watch them (usability studies).
	-	Setting isn't valid, but can stil learn lessons.
	-	Experimental bias; users try harder, be nicer.
	-	Psychological burden to bring someone to you.
-	Surveys
	-	Easy to execute and analyse results.
	-	Difference between what people say and what people do.
-	Focus Groups
	-	Groups of people different. People more submissive or erratic due to group psychology.
	-	Difficult for taboo topics or sexual topics.
-	Feedback from Experts
	-	Heuristic evaluation.
-	Comparative Experiments.
	-	Which option is more effective.
	-	Better then surveys because you see what users do.
	-	Better than usability studies because involves more than one option.
	-	But if online can't see them, and if in person the contrived setting may bias results.
-	Participant Observation.
	-	What users do in their actual scenario, not just short term.
-	Simulation models.
-	Issues to consider
	-	Reliability / precision
	-	Generalisability.
	-	Realism.
	-	Comparison.
	-	Work involved.

### 1.4: The Birth of HCI.

-	Vannevar Bush wrote article in 1940 in the Atlantic about Memex.
	-	Envisioned how future coulod allow people to produce and consume infomation.
	-	Camera on head, hypertext.
-	Grace Hopper invented the compiler and their interfaces.
-	Graphical User Interface.
	-	Input over output, so more intuitive.
-	Doug Engelbart invented the mouse.
-	Alan Kay, at Xerox PARC, prototyped the Dynabook, created the WIMP Windows-Icon-Mouse-Pointer (WIMP) GUI.
